Colab is a hosted version of Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use.  Per [the FAQ Page](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html):\n",

        "Notebooks are shareable in the same way that Google Docs or Google Sheets might be shared. Google drive also saves revision history so that a user can revert changes.  A feature called **sandbox mode** avoids saving revision history automatically so that a User can experiment with the notebook without modifying the original file.  Code is executed in a virtual machine private to your account, and are deleted after they have exceeded their maximum lifetime.  \n",
